Async & Await with error handling (Try & Catch)

Fetch:
=> it is alternative to XHR(XmlHttpRequest)
=> Fetch takes API as a parameter.
=>Syntax: fetch("");
=> Return type is a promise
=> The body section in the fetch is a readable stream
=> to convert readable stream to object(JSON) We need to .json() method
=> data.json(): it is a method to convert the body data into a k:v structure.
**Remember: always need a .then and .catch to handle promise.**


Async and Await
=>it is applicable to the functions
=>a normal func can be converted into async function by putting async keyword.
=>async func always returns a promise.
 =>to handle the promise we have await keyword.
 =>await is used inside the async func.
 =>await helps us to wait until the promise gets resolved.
 =>await replacement for the .then

Error Handling Statement:
//Syntax:     
try {
  
} 
catch (error) {
  
}

try-catch
try: testing block
catch: to handle the error
